# Frequent-Word-Extractor
A small program that extracts words from a given PDF file and sort the words in descending order on frequency of occurrence.

This tool was orignally designed to help with the study of GRE. 'GRE_Text_Completion.pdf' is a collection of text completion questions found in real GRE examinations. The goal was to identify frequently appeared vocabs and to give test prepper a better sense of what vocabs to memorize.
